ROOM:         DESCRIPTIONS:
hole|         You awake to see yourself looking at the light from a HOLE in the ceiling. You look around. It seems you've fallen into a cave. There are two paths, to your LEFT you hear the soft sound of running water. To your right, you hear the squeaks of what seem to be a RAT. Which way do you go? Type "help" for help.|    You remember this room like you remember the bruise on the back of your head. To your LEFT you hear the soft sound of running water. To your right, you hear the squeaks of what seem to be a RAT.
left|         Somehow, your legs are functional and manage to carry you from room to room. This is fortunate, because a torch on the wall reveals another fork in the path, with more rooms. You may follow the sounds of the water to the WATERFALL, walk into the dark, scary TUNNEL, head back to the HOLE you fell into, or perhaps stay and examine the place!| This place is small and claustrophobic, you think to yourself. You can go to the WATERFALL, the dark TUNNEL, or the HOLE where you began.
rat|          You walk towards the sound of a rat. You're shocked. It's a rat.
tunnel|       It's too dark. You let your eyes adjust. It's still too dark. However, you do hear the snarl of an angry canine. You can't go on further, you must head back LEFT.|  Your torch illuminates a fearsome wolf gnawing on fresh meat. After the fight, you may head back LEFT or continue onto the EXTENSION.
extension|    The end of the road. Your torch illuminates a corpse lying against a wall, and a beartrap sits patiently next to you. Looks like there's nothing you can do but head back into the TUNNEL.
secret|       Clicks and clacks of mechanisms hidden within the walls begin, and the door slowly opens up revealing a dimly lit, but otherwise well decorated room. The walls are made up metal, and this place seemingly looks like a lobby of some sort. Furniture is knocked over, papers everywhere, the room is a mess, but you can tell this once held a safe work environment for...someone. You try the doors, and they're all locked except for two. A room with a CAGE startles you as a wolf attempts to jump at you in rage. However, you do spot a couple .50 caliber bullets lying within the cage. The only other available room is one labeled LAB. If you'd like, you can head back to the WATERFALL. | This lobby-esqe room is irksome. You wonder what happened here. You can head into the LAB, "greet" the wolf in the CAGE, or head back into the WATERFALL.
cage|         A fearsome wolf is ready to unleash its rage!
waterfall|    You follow the sounds to a waterfall. The water looks odd, and illuminates the cave. What's that at the base of it? You walk through the water to reveal a securely locked door with a keypad! It has four digit slots, waiting for input. What could possibly be on the other side? | The waterfall is pretty, but its slight glow is off-putting. You step up to the keypad.
lab|          You slide the lab door open, revealing a large, starving bear helping itself to a poor sucker in a lab coat. Uh oh, this is not going to end well!
