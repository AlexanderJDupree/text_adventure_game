ROOM:         DESCRIPTIONS:
start|        You awake to see yourself looking at the light from a hole in the ceiling. You look around. It seems you've fallen into a cave. There are two paths, to your LEFT you hear the soft sound of running water. To your RIGHT, you hear a snarl in the dark. Which way do you go?|    SSart room second dcription
left|         left room first description| left room second description
right|        test wolf encounter
tunnel|       It's too dark, you can't see. Maybe if you had a torch.|  Your torch illuminates a fearsome wolf gnawing on a freshly killed corpse.
waterfall|     Behind the waterfall theres a door! You notice an old looking keypad. It has four digit slots that are blank.
boss_room|     The door swings open revealing the BOSS FIGHT!
